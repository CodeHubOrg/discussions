# discussions
- Create an [issue](https://github.com/codehuborg/discussions/issues) to start a discussion, use comments to contribute to an existing discussion. Use labels as tags.     
- Inspired by the great Nodeschool [discussions repo](https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions/).
- This might replace our [Discourse](http://discourse.codehub.org.uk/) if it works well. One clear benefit is that you don't need to sign up specifically.
